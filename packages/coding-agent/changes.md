# Local fork changes

## 2026-08-13 — omopi is the only installable CLI name

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/package.json` `bin` now contains only `omopi`.
- Root `package.json` declares `bin.omopi` so `npm link` from the monorepo
  root registers that command. It does not register `omo`, `pi`, or `senpi`.
- The root build wrapper writes `dist/omopi` and, when opted in, a global
  `omopi` shim. It no longer writes or replaces a global `senpi`/`pi`/`omo`.
- Local release smoke now looks for the `omopi` bin in isolated installs.
- Root `overrides` pin patched transitive versions for the current npm audit
  findings, and `allowScripts` records npm 12 install-script approvals.

### Why this lives in the fork

- This tree is a personal omopi fork. `pi` belongs to pi-mono, `senpi` to
  upstream senpi, and `omo` is not this product's command. Publishing or
  linking those names would collide with tools the operator already owns.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- npm `bin` maps and the root link wrapper are package metadata and build
  output. An extension cannot change which names `npm link` installs.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/package.json` `bin`
- Root `package.json` `bin`, `overrides`, and `allowScripts`
- `scripts/create-root-senpi-wrapper.mjs` and its test
- `scripts/local-release.mjs` `packageCliCommand`

## 2026-08-12 — Distinguish external-editor launch failures

### What changed

- Prompt editing now reports `launch-failed` when the configured external
  editor process never starts, instead of returning the same `failed` status
  used when an editor actually launches and exits nonzero or by signal.
- Added a deterministic regression that invokes the real prompt-editor code
  with a guaranteed-missing executable and proves the operating system's
  process-launch failure remains distinct from an editor exit.
- Added a bounded stress harness that runs the prompt/file external-editor
  suites 25 times sequentially and four times concurrently, while asserting
  every child exit and exact before/after temporary-directory residue.

### Why this lives in the fork

- Senpi's interactive composer owns the external-editor handoff and its
  temporary prompt file. The return status determines whether callers may
  assume the editor ran and could have produced side effects.
- Full-suite subprocess pressure can make `spawn()` fail before launch. Folding
  that condition into a normal editor failure made tests and callers reason
  from side effects that never happened.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Extensions receive control after the built-in composer and process lifecycle
  contract have already been selected. They cannot distinguish a swallowed
  host `spawn` error from a real editor exit.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `src/modes/interactive/external-editor.ts` around prompt-editor child-process
  outcome handling.
- `test/external-editor.test.ts` around real-child lifecycle coverage.

## 2026-08-11 — Ship codemode with standalone binaries

### What changed

- Added one manifest-driven copier for the source-only codemode runtime payload.
- Both `npm run build:binary` and the six-platform release archive build now
  stage codemode under the executable's adjacent
  `node_modules/@code-yeongyu/senpi-codemode` path.
- A clean package-level `build:binary` now builds the PTY workspace before
  coding-agent so its declarations are present without relying on stale root
  build output.
- Package-level binary compilation now embeds `css-tree`, matching the
  six-platform release build instead of externalizing a dependency that Bun's
  `$bunfs` resolver cannot load from an adjacent `node_modules`.
- The copier replaces stale output and excludes package tests, development
  dependencies, and repository-only files.

### Why this lives in the fork

- Codemode is a fork-owned default-on extension distributed with Senpi.
  npm's `bundleDependencies` controls npm tarballs but does not embed or copy
  dynamically resolved source packages into Bun standalone archives.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The archive layout and Bun sidecars are constructed before user extensions
  load, so an extension cannot add its own missing package to the executable
  distribution.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/package.json` around `copy-binary-assets`.
- `scripts/build-binaries.sh` around shared platform sidecars.
- `scripts/copy-codemode-sidecar.mjs` and its contract test.

## 2026-08-09 — General extension filesystem policy API

### What changed

- Documented `pi.registerFilesystemPolicy()` as a factory-time API for canonical read, enumerate, and write decisions.
- Added deterministic coverage for registration, deny-wins composition, real/missing/symlink path canonicalization, all
  six built-in file tools, denied-root metadata, approval-hook non-bypassability, and a general extension that limits
  writes to its own workspace root.

### Why this lives in the fork

- The public extension contract and built-in executor tests are package-level surfaces. A consumer extension can use the
  policy after it exists but cannot add or verify the host hook itself.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `docs/extensions.md`, `test/filesystem-policy.test.ts`, and package type-export lists.

## 2026-08-03 — Keep Bun off unpublished workspace identities

### What changed

- Moved the built client and protocol payloads from the package-manager-owned `node_modules` bundle into flat `vendor/pi-client` and `vendor/pi-protocol` trees.
- Rewrote coding-agent declaration/runtime imports and the vendored client package's protocol imports to relative paths inside that vendor tree.
- Removed client/protocol registry edges from the published Senpi manifest while preserving their runtime and declaration surface in the tarball.
- Pinned fork-owned registry aliases and the codemode Senpi peer to the exact CalVer revision instead of caret ranges that can select an older stable release over a `-N` revision.
- Made the staging contract explicit: local publish validation rewrites emitted `dist` imports and must rebuild coding-agent after restoring the checked manifest.
- Removed the uncreatable `@code-yeongyu/senpi-client` and `@code-yeongyu/senpi-protocol` entries from the publish matrix.
- Added release-script coverage for exact resolver targets, the publish matrix, vendored package identities, peer pinning, and rewritten declarations.

### Why this lives in the fork

- Bun resolves npm registry metadata before consuming bundled dependencies, so unpublished workspace identities cannot remain in the effective package-manager graph even when their files are embedded in the tarball.
- CalVer revisions such as `2026.8.3-2` are SemVer prereleases; a caret range can legally resolve to the older stable `2026.8.3`, reintroducing that release's broken dependency graph.
- npm trusted publishing is configured per existing package and cannot bootstrap a new package name, so adding standalone client/protocol aliases made the release workflow fail before the Senpi package could publish.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The resolver aliases, exact version pins, vendored declaration paths, bundle manifest, and package publication order are generated inside the repository release scripts; an extension cannot change npm metadata or the contents of the published tarball.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `scripts/prepare-senpi-publish-manifest.mjs` registry alias and exact-version mapping.
- `scripts/prepare-senpi-bundled-workspaces.mjs` bundled/vendored workspace staging and declaration rewriting.
- `scripts/publish-manifest.mjs` codemode peer pinning.
- `scripts/publish.mjs` package publication list.
- `scripts/prepare-senpi-bundled-workspaces.prepare.test.mjs`, `scripts/prepare-senpi-publish-optionals.test.mjs`, `scripts/publish-manifest.test.mjs`, and `scripts/publish-registry-dependencies.test.mjs` release coverage.

## 2026-08-03 — Make the editor prompt marker visually explicit

### What changed

- Reserved a two-column prompt gutter in the coding-agent `CustomEditor`.
- Rendered an accent-styled `❯` on the first editable row and aligned wrapped rows beneath the text column.
- Preserved that gutter when session/settings reloads reapply an `editorPaddingX` value below two.
- Kept `getPaddingX()` reporting the configured value so existing editor construction and extension handoff contracts remain stable.
- Hid the marker when the editor is vertically scrolled so it never appears beside a continuation row.
- Kept sub-five-column rendering on the previous no-marker fallback to avoid narrow-terminal overflow.

### Why this lives in the fork

- The marker is part of the coding-agent interactive composer layout, including width reservation, wrapping, cursor placement, and autocomplete alignment.
- Extensions can replace the editor but cannot decorate the built-in editor's private render loop without reimplementing its editing behavior.

### Expected upstream merge-conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/components/custom-editor.ts` around `CustomEditor` construction and rendering.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/custom-editor-prompt.test.ts` around built-in composer rendering assertions.

## 2026-08-01 — Reconcile fork runtime contracts after the upstream merge

### What changed

- Updated Grok themes for the merged scrollbar color contract while preserving their non-palette inheritance.
- Kept implicit legacy `SYSTEM.md` and `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` files excluded from both prompt content and source metadata.
- Restored source-runtime extension aliases, Alt Screen help grouping, and package-declared hook discovery.
- Added the merged protocol and client workspaces to the root build graph in dependency order so clean CI runners produce their declarations before dependent packages compile.
- Updated deterministic test hosts for merged session abort, Markdown transformer, UI mode, fullscreen scrollbar, and offline-network contracts.
- Made the `/btw` concurrent snapshot test wait for the exact side-provider entry signal instead of relying on provider-call timing.

### Why

- Upstream added runtime capabilities and lifecycle requirements on surfaces that also carry fork-only behavior. The merge preserved most production code but omitted three fork integration fields and left several fork tests modeling the pre-merge runtime shape.
- The resulting full package suite had 25 coding-agent failures despite narrower focused suites being green, and clean CI builds could not resolve the newly merged client and protocol workspaces because local validation had pre-existing `dist` artifacts.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- These behaviors span package loading, built-in help, manifest parsing, session lifecycle, interactive rendering, and the repository's deterministic faux-provider tests before extension-level customization can repair them.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `scripts/build-all.mjs`, `src/core/extensions/loader.ts`, `src/core/pi-manifest.ts`, `src/core/resource-loader.ts`, `src/modes/interactive/help-content.ts`, Grok theme JSON, `interactive-mode.ts` test hosts, session-runtime tests, model-network policy tests, and `/btw` concurrency coverage.

## 2026-08-01 — Preserve the no-shipped-shrinkwrap install contract

### What changed

- Removed the upstream `packages/coding-agent/npm-shrinkwrap.json` that was reintroduced by the merge.
- Updated the root supply-chain documentation to identify `publish-deps.lock.json` as the staging-only generated manifest and to state that `npm-shrinkwrap.json` must not ship.

### Why

- The fork deliberately removed the npm shrinkwrap because npm force-packs that filename and treats it as the complete locked bundled tree, skipping non-bundled direct dependencies and leaving installed CLIs broken with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.
- Keeping the reintroduced file or the stale README claim would contradict the existing pack guard and misdirect the next release or upstream merge.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Package tarball contents, publish staging metadata, and repository release documentation are owned before the Senpi runtime and extension system start.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/npm-shrinkwrap.json`, root `README.md` supply-chain documentation, `scripts/generate-coding-agent-shrinkwrap.mjs`, and publish pack guards.

## 2026-08-01 — Backfill local release and publish hardening

### What changed

- Local release tests build packages first and run smoke tests serially.
- Release output prints the exact npm publish command and permits authenticated local publishing.
- Provenance metadata, publish roots, and publish directories now match the fork's declared package layout.

### Why

- Local release evidence must exercise built artifacts and produce commands that work from the actual fork package roots.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- The behavior is owned by repository release, publish, provenance, and smoke-test scripts.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `scripts/local-release.mjs`, `scripts/publish.mjs`, release smoke helpers, and package publish metadata.

## 2026-07-31 — Claude SDK OAuth provider identity

- Changed: renamed Senpi's SDK-backed Claude subscription provider and every active internal surface from `claude-agent-sdk` to `claude-sdk-oauth`, including auth storage, settings, commands, RPC/app-server account routing, tests, docs, and QA scenarios.
- Preserved: Anthropic's upstream package and platform sidecar names remain `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`.
- Coverage: three captured RED→GREEN contracts pin registry/login/path behavior; focused provider tests and real CLI/TUI QA cover the renamed surface.
- Merge-conflict risk: high in the provider directory and its tests; medium in builtin registration and account protocol imports.

## 2026-07-30 — CalVer-aware update ordering

- Changed: package update checks now compare Senpi's `YYYY.M.D-N` same-day revisions using the release contract, where the bare date is revision 1 and `-2`, `-3`, and later suffixes are newer releases.
- Why: npm semver treats `2026.7.30-2` as a prerelease older than `2026.7.30`, so a client on the second same-day release could incorrectly "update" back to the first release.
- Coverage: `test/version-check.test.ts` proves same-day revision ordering, cross-day ordering, and both update-detection directions while preserving normal semver comparisons.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. The change is isolated to the shared package-version comparator and its focused tests.

## 2026-07-30 — Root-owned consumer sidecar installation (#446)

- Changed: publish staging now removes promoted platform optional-dependency edges from the bundled portable package manifest after copying the complete family to Senpi's root optional dependencies.
- Why: npm 11 placed `claude-agent-sdk-darwin-arm64` for the root and bundled SDK edges but never fetched its tarball, leaving an invalid empty directory. A fresh `2026.7.29-5` install therefore still failed native resolution even though the universal tarball contained zero platform sidecar files.
- What changed: the literal issue-446 test proves the root retains all eight Claude platform optionals while the staged bundled SDK owns none, so npm has one consumer-resolved edge and downloads the real Darwin executable.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: npm synthesizes the invalid empty dependency directory before Senpi or its provider runtime starts.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. Expected conflict zones are publish-manifest staging and the focused issue-446 packaging test.

## 2026-07-30 — Strip publisher-native packages before npm pack (#446)

- Changed: after promoting complete platform optional-dependency families into the root manifest, publish staging now removes every platform-constrained package directory before npm traverses bundled dependency graphs.
- Why: excluding the Linux sidecar from `bundleDependencies` was not sufficient. npm still followed the bundled portable Claude SDK's installed optional dependency and physically embedded the publisher's `claude-agent-sdk-linux-x64` files in the universal tarball.
- What changed: the literal issue-446 test now runs real `npm pack --dry-run` and asserts the Linux sidecar path is absent, while the consumer optional contract remains intact for darwin-arm64 installation.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: the publisher-native files were already baked into the npm artifact before install or runtime extension loading.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. Expected conflict zones are publish-manifest staging and the focused issue-446 packaging test.

## 2026-07-30 — Publish gate honors consumer-resolved platform optionals (#446)

- Changed: `assertSenpiPackedWorkspaceFiles()` now validates the staged `bundleDependencies` contract when it is available, while retaining the legacy all-runtime fallback for callers without a staged manifest.
- Why: issue #446 intentionally promotes complete native optional-dependency families into the published root manifest so npm can select the consumer platform. The publish-only workflow still treated those non-bundled optionals as missing vendored files and stopped before npm publication.
- What changed: `publish.mjs` passes the staged bundle list into the pack assertion, and focused RED→GREEN coverage proves a bundled portable Claude SDK may omit the consumer-resolved `darwin-arm64` package from the universal tarball.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: the failure occurs in npm tarball validation before package publication or runtime extension loading.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. Expected conflict zones are the publish pack assertion, `publish.mjs`, and the focused packaging test.

## 2026-07-29 — Consumer-resolved Claude Agent SDK sidecars (#446)

- Changed: publish-manifest staging now promotes a bundled package's complete platform-specific optional dependency family into the root `@code-yeongyu/senpi` manifest while continuing to exclude the publish runner's materialized native package from `bundleDependencies`.
- Why: the universal npm tarball bundled `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk-linux-x64` from the Linux publish runner. npm did not re-resolve the bundled SDK's nested optional dependencies on install, so Apple Silicon consumers received no `darwin-arm64` Claude executable and the provider failed before authentication.
- What changed: extracted publish-manifest construction into `scripts/prepare-senpi-publish-manifest.mjs`, kept workspace staging and pack checks in `prepare-senpi-bundled-workspaces.mjs`, split the oversized packaging test suite by responsibility, and added issue #446 plus unreadable-manifest RED→GREEN coverage. A real local release installed only `claude-agent-sdk-darwin-arm64` on this Mac and resolved its `claude` binary with `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` unset.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: npm dependency bundling and consumer-side optional dependency resolution happen before the Senpi runtime and extension loader start.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. Expected conflict zones are publish-manifest staging and the colocated packaging tests; runtime provider code is unchanged.

## 2026-07-29 — OpenAI Codex usage extension example

- Changed: added a standalone `examples/extensions/openai-codex-usage/` example that resolves Senpi-managed Codex OAuth, fetches the remaining five-hour and weekly limits, and publishes them through `ctx.ui.setStatus()`. Missing windows render as unavailable; sanitized HTTP/network/parse failures replace stale values with an unavailable status. The poller is single-flight, abortable, and cleared on model changes, shutdown, or `/usage`.
- Why: users can see provider limits with the built-in footer or any custom footer that consumes extension statuses, without coupling usage retrieval to one footer implementation or presenting unknown/stale percentages as current.
- Extension boundary: the example uses public model-registry, lifecycle, command, and status APIs; no core footer or authentication source changes are required. Deterministic fake-API and fake-timer tests cover toggle, model-change, abort, scheduled polling, and shutdown cleanup.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. The change adds an isolated example directory, one test, one catalog row, documentation, and this record.

## 2026-07-28 — Billing-class provider errors always pin the session model swap

- Changed: billing-class failures (credit balance, insufficient quota) engage the fallback chain with the pinned `"billing"` reason unconditionally — the candidate becomes the session model for the rest of the session and never auto-reverts. Files: `src/core/retry-fallback/billing.ts` (classifier), `src/core/retry-fallback/controller.ts` (billing reason pins and notes the cooldown), `src/core/agent-session.ts` (classifies hard-error-eligible failures). Non-billing hard errors keep the temporary, revertable switch. Supersedes the opt-in `retry.billingErrorPolicy` variant of the same change; the setting no longer exists.
- Why: a credit-exhausted account never recovers within a session, but the ordinary hard-error fallback reverted to the dead model after the 30-minute billing cooldown, killing later turns. Observed in a real session (anthropic-api claude-fable-5, 2026-07-28): the turn died with a 400 "credit balance is too low".
- Coverage: `test/suite/retry-fallback-billing-swap.test.ts` (billing errors pin and hold past the cooldown with default settings, non-billing hard errors stay temporary, classifier table) and `test/suite/retry-fallback-hard-error.test.ts` (insufficient-quota fixture now reports the billing reason).
- Merge-conflict risk: low. Additive union members and one engagement branch; the controller's reason handling is the expected conflict zone.

## 2026-07-26 — Resolve Bun dependencies through fork-owned aliases (#230)

- Changed: `scripts/publish.mjs` stages the four upstream-named private source
  packages as `@code-yeongyu/senpi-ai`, `@code-yeongyu/senpi-agent-core`,
  `@code-yeongyu/senpi-tui`, and `@code-yeongyu/senpi-pty`, alongside
  `@code-yeongyu/senpi-codemode` and `@code-yeongyu/senpi`. The source package
  manifests retain `private: true` and their `@earendil-works/*` names.
- Why: Bun resolves declared dependencies from npm and ignores npm's
  `bundleDependencies`, while the upstream-owned `@earendil-works` namespace
  neither grants this fork publish access nor contains the fork's lockstep
  versions. Removing those dependency keys makes npm omit their bundled copies.
- What changed: the staged senpi manifest preserves each original dependency
  key so npm packs it at the source import path, but rewrites its spec to an
  npm alias targeting the matching `@code-yeongyu/senpi-*` package. Bun fetches
  only the owned alias; npm retains and resolves the bundled original package.
  The code source imports stay unchanged, and `@code-yeongyu/senpi-server`
  remains private.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. `scripts/publish.mjs` temporary manifest staging
  and `stagePublishManifest()` alias rewriting are the expected conflict zones.

## 2026-08-12 — app-server extension RPC coverage and documentation

- Changed: added focused app-server suites for extension event audience/one-frame delivery and request round-trips with
  unknown and duplicate handler errors; documented the additive method and notification wire shapes.
- Why: app-server had no executable contract for the existing extension-owned RPC channel, even though classic RPC did.
- What changed: `test/suite/app-server-extension-events.test.ts`,
  `test/suite/app-server-extension-requests.test.ts`, `docs/app-server.md`, and the package `CHANGELOG.md` now cover the
  real runtime surface and release note with isolated temporary extension directories and no network or credentials.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: tests and public protocol documentation describe the host connection
  boundary; an extension cannot install or verify those repository-level contracts.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. The focused test files are new; the supported-method and notification sections in
  `docs/app-server.md` are the only shared conflict zones.

## 2026-07-22 — app-server runtime import test without npm subprocess

- Changed: `test/suite/app-server-protocol.test.ts` now executes its runtime `.js` import probe with
  `node --import tsx --eval` instead of `npx tsx -e`.
- Why: npm configuration warnings are unrelated to the protocol import contract but are emitted on the spawned
  subprocess stderr in CI, making the otherwise-successful test fail.
- What changed: test runner invocation only; the imported module, assertions, and runtime behavior are unchanged.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: this is hermetic package test infrastructure, not runtime extension
  behavior.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. The only conflict zone is the subprocess invocation in the focused protocol metadata test.

## 2026-07-22 — Fully self-contained publish tarball (npm packaging MODULE_NOT_FOUND fix)

- Changed:
  - `scripts/prepare-senpi-bundled-workspaces.mjs`
  - `scripts/prepare-senpi-bundled-workspaces.test.mjs`
  - `scripts/prepare-senpi-bundled-workspaces.prepare.test.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish.mjs`
  - `scripts/AGENTS.md`
- Why: fresh `npm i -g @code-yeongyu/senpi` (both 2026.7.20-2 and 2026.7.22) nondeterministically
  dropped registry runtime deps (cross-spawn, which, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk), leaving the CLI
  dead with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND. The publish tarball vendored only the 5 bundled workspace
  packages + their closure; npm arborist, forced to fetch the remaining 39 runtime deps from the
  registry, could hit ETARGET on the registry-absent `^2026.x` workspace specs and abort reify
  mid-flight, leaving a half-installed tree.
- What changed: staging now vendors the ENTIRE runtime closure (all registry deps + transitives
  from `publish-deps.lock.json`, as before via `copyPublishDependencies`) and
  `stagePublishManifest` rewrites the publish manifest at staging time so `bundleDependencies`
  (and the `bundledDependencies` alias) lists every staged package. All `dependencies` edges —
  including the 5 `^2026.x` workspace specs — are preserved; with the complete bundle npm needs
  no registry fetch at install time. `stagePublishManifest` also rejects `file:`/`link:`/
  `workspace:` specs and any declared runtime dep missing from the staged node_modules.
  `assertSenpiPackedWorkspaceFiles` gained a `runtimeDependencies` pack check (wired in
  `scripts/publish.mjs`) so a tarball missing any vendored runtime dep fails before publish.
  `publish-deps.lock.json` remains staging-only and is never shipped; no new lifecycle-script
  dependencies were added.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. Release tooling only; no runtime source touched.

## 2026-07-21 — Codex HEAD app-server parity documentation refresh

- Changed:
  - `docs/app-server.md`, `src/modes/app-server/AGENTS.md`, and the package changelog: documented the final
    capability-mapped Codex HEAD surface, protocol provenance, intentionally unsupported requests, and the
    source-oracle differential harness.
- Why: integrations need an accurate compatibility boundary. The prior inventory still described implemented
  parity methods as unavailable and did not explain deliberate differences such as restart-time history
  reconstruction, aggregated diffs, the settings subset, or honest account reads.
- What changed: documentation and its hermetic documentation checker only; no app-server runtime behavior changed.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: protocol compatibility, runtime invariants, and QA-harness
  operation are package-level contracts rather than extension behavior.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. The primary conflict zone is the app-server capability table when the Codex protocol
  pin changes again.

## 2026-07-20 — Codex HEAD app-server facade and contract fixtures

- Changed:
  - `src/modes/app-server/protocol/` and related app-server runtime seams: added the handwritten Node-compatible facade,
    HEAD method/experimental-notification catalogs, populated notification envelopes, deferred post-response actions,
    and the canonical terminal error/completion pair.
  - `test/fixtures/app-server-methods-codex-head.json`, app-server facade/error/notification/dispatch/terminal suites, and
    the QA capability manifest: pin the source-derived catalogs and the intended wire behavior without importing the
    generated tree at runtime. The source-driven QA probes also assert that notification timestamps survive transport
    serialization while approval server requests remain unstamped.
- Why: Codex's generated TypeScript exporter intentionally excludes experimental request roots, while Senpi still needs
  a complete typed contract for the capability-mapped parity work and evidence that catalog or envelope drift fails
  loudly.
- What changed: protocol/runtime/test surface only; the generated Codex fixture remains byte-identical and the existing
  remote-control response is intentionally left for its later implementation task.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: app-server method registration, transport envelopes, and JSON-RPC
  frame ordering happen below the extension API.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. The app-server tree and HEAD fixture are fork-only; on a future Codex pin, regenerate evidence
  first and then re-derive the handwritten facade.

## 2026-07-21 — config-reload settings-manager seam

- Changed: `src/core/settings-manager.ts` tracks recent process-written settings content hashes by absolute path, with bounded, expiring, consume-on-match entries shared across settings-manager and storage instances.
- Why: the default-on config-reload builtin must ignore its own settings writes without suppressing a later identical external edit or losing rapid consecutive writes.
- What changed: the exported `wasSelfWrite()` query and path helpers are fork-specific storage seams; the `configReload` setting augmentation remains owned by the builtin so core settings semantics stay unchanged when the builtin is unused.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: the persistence write path is owned by `FileSettingsStorage` and `InMemorySettingsStorage`, outside extension lifecycle hooks.
- Merge-conflict risk: medium around settings storage writes and exported settings-manager helpers.

## 2026-07-20 — paced streaming tool argument preview coverage

- Changed:
  - `test/tool-args-reveal.test.ts`: deterministic fake-timer coverage for initial visibility, monotonic catch-up,
    64-unit parse batching, surrogate-safe slicing, exact per-call/all-call flushes, disabled-setting cancellation, and
    live FPS refreshes.
  - `test/suite/regressions/4167-thinking-toggle-pending-tool-render.test.ts`: extends the prototype harness with the
    tool-argument reveal flush seam used when pending components are rebuilt.
  - `test/interactive-mode-status.test.ts`: extends the active-tool lifecycle fixture with the tool-argument reveal
    flush/finish seams and direct exact-argument update surface.
- Why: streamed tool arguments need the same stable cadence as assistant text without exposing malformed Unicode or
  allowing a stale timer to overwrite exact execution arguments.
- What changed: focused package test coverage; runtime changes are tracked in the nearest `src/**/changes.md` files.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: the tests pin private interactive pending-tool and timer lifecycles.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. The suite and controller are fork-only; runtime wiring risk is documented under `src/`.

## 2026-07-20 — smooth streaming reveal test coverage

- Changed:
  - `test/streaming-reveal.test.ts`: deterministic coverage for incremental grapheme counting and slicing, display
    message construction, fps-invariant reveal timing, and controller lifecycle behavior.
  - `test/settings-manager.test.ts`: defaults, clamping, and persistence coverage for smooth-streaming settings.
  - `test/interactive-mode-compaction-queue-session-rebind.test.ts`: session-rebind test doubles now include the reveal
    controller `stop` seam so the full CI suite exercises the updated `InteractiveMode` shape.
- Why: the interactive reveal must remain Unicode-safe and time-based across 30–120fps, including live setting and
  visibility changes.
- What changed: test-only package surface; runtime changes are tracked in the nearest `src/**/changes.md` files.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: the tests exercise private built-in TUI lifecycle and settings state.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. Both suites are focused additions to the package test surface.

## 2026-07-07 — pi-pty workspace dependency groundwork

- Changed:
  - `package.json` (+ `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, `install-lock/package-lock.json`): added the fork's
    `@earendil-works/pi-pty` workspace package to `dependencies` and `bundledDependencies`.
- Why: groundwork for the persistent-terminal tool; the native PTY runtime (`packages/pty`, `crates/senpi-pty`) is
  fork-native and ships bundled like the other workspace packages.
- What changed: dependency wiring only; no coding-agent runtime files consume it yet.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: bundled workspace dependencies are package-level release surface.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. `dependencies` / `bundledDependencies` lists in `package.json`.

## 2026-07-07 — MCP W1 package surface (dependency, tests, fixtures)

- Changed:
  - `package.json` (+ `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, `install-lock/package-lock.json`): exact-pinned
    `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` dependency.
  - `test/mcp/**`: MCP test fixtures with chaos knobs (`stdio-server.ts`, `http-server.ts`, `sdk-server.ts`,
    `spawn-fixture.ts`, schema goldens) and suites covering config/security, transport, connection, service
    lifecycle, registration/call semantics, exposure policy, `/mcp` commands, instructions injection, log redaction,
    and async wrap behavior.
- Why: the MCP W1 builtin (see `src/core/extensions/builtin/mcp/changes.md`) needs deterministic, token-free
  end-to-end coverage against real stdio/http servers, including failure injection.
- What changed: fork-only test/fixture surface plus the pinned SDK dependency; no runtime files outside
  `builtin/mcp/` and `builtin/index.ts`.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: package dependencies and the test harness are package-level
  surfaces.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. `test/mcp/` does not exist upstream; the dependency pin only conflicts if upstream ever
  adopts the MCP SDK.

## 2026-07-06 — app-server and neo docs/test surface

- Changed:
  - `docs/app-server.md`, `docs/neo.md`: protocol/activation documentation for the fork's app-server mode and the neo
    daemon (process-isolation rationale included).
  - App-server test suites (transports, thread lifecycle, approvals, projection, daemon supervision) and neo test
    suites (`neo-daemon-mode`, `neo-auth-rpc`, `neo-args-parse`, `neo-argv`, registry self-heal, spawn-race
    convergence).
- Why: both features are fork-native modes (see `src/changes.md`, `src/modes/rpc/changes.md`); docs and tests pin
  their wire contracts and daemon semantics.
- What changed: documentation and test additions only at the package root; runtime changes are tracked in the
  per-directory changes.md files.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: package docs and the test harness are package-level surfaces.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. The docs and suites are fork-only files.

## 2026-07-02 — upstream extension renderer docs and regression sync

- Changed:
  - `docs/extensions.md`
  - `docs/sdk.md`
  - `docs/session-format.md`
  - `examples/extensions/README.md`
  - `examples/extensions/entry-renderer.ts`
  - `test/auth-storage.test.ts`
  - `test/extensions-discovery.test.ts`
  - `test/extensions-runner.test.ts`
  - `test/model-resolver.test.ts`
  - `test/session-manager/build-context.test.ts`
  - `test/suite/regressions/4167-thinking-toggle-pending-tool-render.test.ts`
- Why: The upstream sync adds extension entry renderers, public model-resolution helpers, auth-save failure reporting,
  split-turn compaction serialization, and bash timeout validation. The docs, example extension, and tests document and
  pin those user-visible behaviors for the fork.
- What changed: Accepted upstream docs/examples/tests for the synced behaviors while preserving fork-specific runtime
  expectations such as compaction detail propagation and model-resolution warning behavior.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: these are documentation, example, and regression-test updates for the
  package API and runtime behavior; extensions can consume the API, but they cannot document or verify package-level
  contracts.
- Merge-conflict risk: low to medium. Expected conflict zones are the extension renderer docs/example, model-resolution
  SDK docs, and focused regression assertions if upstream revises these APIs again.

## 2026-05-15 — stop rebuilding linked `senpi` on launch

- Changed:
  - `scripts/build-all.mjs`
  - `scripts/create-root-senpi-wrapper.mjs`
  - `scripts/create-root-senpi-wrapper.test.mjs`
- Why: The PATH-visible `senpi` command should not pay a build cost every time it starts. Build/link should create or refresh the shim, and regular launches should only execute the already-built CLI.
- What changed: Removed the git HEAD stamp, source mtime scan, dist marker check, and launch-time `scripts/build-all.mjs` call from the generated root wrapper. The build helper now also deletes the legacy `.senpi-build-head` marker when refreshing `dist/senpi`.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: this happens in the PATH shim before the coding-agent runtime or extension loader starts.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. The expected conflict zone is `scripts/create-root-senpi-wrapper.mjs` if upstream changes local build/link behavior.

## 2026-05-15 — rebuild stale linked CLI before launching `senpi`

- Changed:
  - `scripts/build-all.mjs`
  - `scripts/create-root-senpi-wrapper.mjs`
  - `scripts/create-root-senpi-wrapper.test.mjs`
- Why: The PATH-visible `senpi` shim runs the root `dist/senpi` wrapper. If source changes were committed but the workspace dist artifacts were not rebuilt, the linked command could still execute stale `packages/*/dist` code and reproduce fixed bugs.
- What changed: The root build writes the git HEAD it built into `dist/.senpi-build-head`. The generated root wrapper now rebuilds when that stamp is missing or stale, when required dist markers are missing, or when relevant workspace source/package/script mtimes are newer than the build stamp. In a git checkout, if any check says the linked build is stale, it runs `scripts/build-all.mjs` before launching `packages/coding-agent/dist/senpi`.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: stale dist is a build/link packaging problem that occurs before the runtime extension system starts.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. The expected conflict zone is `scripts/create-root-senpi-wrapper.mjs` if upstream changes the local build/link shim.

## 2026-05-13 — copy all non-TypeScript resources into dist via copy-assets

- Changed: `packages/coding-agent/package.json`
- Why: `tsgo` does not copy non-`.ts` assets into `dist/`, but `scripts/build-binaries.sh` expects interactive theme JSON files, PNG assets, and export-html templates to exist there when packaging release binaries. The previous fix only copied theme JSON, so CI still failed on missing `dist/modes/interactive/assets/*` and `dist/core/export-html/`.
- What changed: Replaced the inline theme-only copy in the `build` script with `npm run copy-assets`, which already covers theme JSON, PNG assets, and export-html templates + vendor JS in one step.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. The expected conflict zone is the `build` script in `packages/coding-agent/package.json` if upstream changes packaging flow.

## 2026-05-12 — add pi-todotools to builtin sync

- Changed:
  - `packages/coding-agent/scripts/sync-builtin-extensions.mjs`
  - `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/external-versions.json`
  - `README.md`
- Why: The todo tools now live in the public sibling `../pi-extensions/pi-todotools` repository, but senpi should continue to ship them as a builtin.
- What changed: Added sync mappings and documentation for the vendored `todowrite` builtin source.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. Expected conflict zones are the builtin sync file list, external version manifest, and README builtin tables.

## 2026-04-05 — add `senpi` CLI alias

- Changed: `packages/coding-agent/package.json`
- Why: The user wants the built CLI to be directly runnable via `senpi`. This cannot be implemented through the extension system because shell command exposure is controlled by the package `bin` map, not runtime extension hooks.
- What changed: Added a second CLI bin alias, `senpi`, pointing at the existing `dist/cli.js` entrypoint alongside `pi`.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. The only expected conflict zone is the `bin` field in `packages/coding-agent/package.json` if upstream changes CLI entrypoint names or packaging layout.

## 2026-04-09 — fix stale coding-agent baseline test expectations

- Changed:
  - `packages/coding-agent/test/resource-loader.test.ts`
  - two legacy permission suite files
- Why: upstream and prior fork work changed the builtin extension set, removed `SYSTEM.md` / `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` discovery, and split tool-call permission blocking into `permission-system`. The pre-existing tests were asserting the old behavior and kept the coding-agent Vitest suite red.
- What changed:
  - Updated `resource-loader.test.ts` to account for the current builtin extension identifiers, builtin `/tui` command presence, always-loaded builtin extensions during command-collision scenarios, and the intentional absence of `SYSTEM.md` / `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` loading.
  - Updated the legacy integration coverage to assert that denied tool calls are no longer blocked directly outside `permission-system`.
  - Updated the legacy permission coverage to exercise the current `permission-system` extension behavior for deny, allow, ask-without-UI, and `Allow always` flows.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: these failures were stale assertions in test files. No runtime extension could correct incorrect test expectations without changing the tests themselves.
- Merge-conflict risk: medium. The likely conflict zones are the affected assertion blocks in those three test files if upstream changes resource loading, builtin registration, or permission-system behavior again.

## 2026-04-12 — emit a callable `senpi` artifact from the standard build

- Changed:
  - `packages/coding-agent/package.json`
  - `package.json`
  - `scripts/create-root-senpi-wrapper.mjs`
- Why: The user wants root-level `npm run build` to be sufficient in the same practical sense that `senpi` was: after building, there should be a directly callable `senpi` command, not just an internal package artifact. A plain copied file in root `dist/` was not enough for `which senpi`; the build also needed to refresh a PATH-visible shim.
- What changed:
  - Updated the coding-agent `build` script to emit `dist/senpi` alongside `dist/cli.js`.
  - Updated the root `build` script to generate a root `dist/senpi` wrapper that delegates to `packages/coding-agent/dist/cli.js`.
  - Added a small build helper at `scripts/create-root-senpi-wrapper.mjs` to write that root wrapper.
  - Updated the root build helper to also write a small `senpi` shim into npm's global `bin/` directory, so `which senpi` resolves after a successful root build.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: root build orchestration, emitted files, and PATH-visible shim installation are packaging concerns controlled by package scripts, not runtime extensions.
- Merge-conflict risk: low to medium. The likely conflict zones are the root `scripts.build` line, the coding-agent `scripts.build` line, the build helper script, and this fork note if upstream changes packaging flow or build helpers.

## 2026-04-17 — drop external `uuid` dep by inlining UUIDv7 generation

- Changed:
  - `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts`
  - `packages/coding-agent/package.json`
- Why: Upstream (commit 018b40c3) switched session id generation to `uuidv7()` from the `uuid` npm package and added `"uuid": "^11.1.0"` to `dependencies`. Downstream consumers of `@code-yeongyu/senpi` (including Sionic Storm's carrier-ordersheet tooling) were hitting runtime failures in `subscription-control.test.ts` and `headless-runtime.test.ts` because `dist/core/session-manager.js` could not resolve `"uuid"` when the consumer's install did not hoist the transitive dep. This bricks any consumer that bundles only the built `dist/` tree or uses a package-lock that predates the `uuid` addition.
- What changed:
  - Replaced the `import { v7 as uuidv7 } from "uuid"` call with a ~15-line inline UUIDv7 generator built on Node's stock `crypto.randomBytes`. Format conforms to RFC 9562 (version nibble `0x7`, variant bits `10`), preserves millisecond-granularity time ordering (still honors the original intent from upstream #3018: session id routing affinity), and uses no external packages.
  - Removed `"uuid": "^11.1.0"` from `dependencies`, eliminating the transitive requirement entirely.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: session id generation runs inside core `SessionManager` before any extension context exists. Extensions cannot patch an `import` in `dist/`, and consumers hit the failure before any extension hook fires.
- Merge-conflict risk: medium. The expected conflict zones are `packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` lines ~1-45 (imports + inline `uuidv7` helper) and `packages/coding-agent/package.json` `dependencies` block if upstream changes the `uuid` version or adds a different session id generator. On the next upstream sync, the resolution is: keep this fork's inline implementation; do NOT re-add `"uuid"` to dependencies.

## 2026-04-17 — make monorepo build cleanly under npm, bun, and pnpm (consolidated)

- Changed:
  - `package.json` (root)
  - `packages/agent/package.json`
  - `packages/ai/package.json`
  - `packages/coding-agent/package.json`
  - `packages/web-ui/package.json`
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (new)
  - `scripts/build-all.mjs` (new)
  - `scripts/run-web-ui-check.mjs` (new)
  - `.npmrc` temporarily added then removed in favor of `pnpm-workspace.yaml` camelCase keys
- Why: The original layout relied exclusively on npm's flat/hoisted install to satisfy cross-workspace transitive imports, and the root `build` / `check` scripts hardcoded `npm run X` while cd-ing through packages. That meant:
  - bun and pnpm both refused to install because several workspaces imported modules they did not declare as direct deps, and the root `package.json` still carried a stale `"@code-yeongyu/senpi": "^0.30.2"` dependency from the rename from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`.
  - Under pnpm/bun, every nested `npm run X` inside a root build spewed `npm warn Unknown env config ...` for each pnpm-only `npm_config_*` env var (`node_linker`, `link_workspace_packages`, etc.) that pnpm/bun exposed to child processes.
  - bun's default install blocked postinstalls for native addons (`@parcel/watcher`, `koffi`, `protobufjs`), and pnpm 10 blocked the same plus `canvas` and `esbuild`, printing approval prompts on every install.
- What changed:
  - Root `package.json`: removed orphaned `"@code-yeongyu/senpi": "^0.30.2"` from `dependencies` (forcing bun to 404 against the public npm registry before workspace resolution ever ran). Replaced the hardcoded `"build": "cd packages/tui && npm run build && ..."` with `"build": "node scripts/build-all.mjs"`, and replaced `"check": "... && npm run check:browser-smoke && cd packages/web-ui && npm run check"` with a `node`-based invocation plus `node scripts/run-web-ui-check.mjs`. Added `trustedDependencies` (for bun) and `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` (for pnpm) to preapprove the postinstall scripts bun and pnpm would otherwise block.
  - Added missing direct dependencies that are used in `src/`:
    - `packages/agent/package.json`: `@sinclair/typebox` (used in `src/types.ts`).
    - `packages/ai/package.json`: `@smithy/node-http-handler`, `@smithy/types` (used in `src/providers/amazon-bedrock.ts`), and `yaml` (used in `src/tool-call-middleware/protocols/yaml-xml.ts`, which is a fork-only file). Also replaced the nested `"build": "npm run generate-models && tsgo ..."` with `"prebuild": "tsx scripts/generate-models.ts"` + `"build": "tsgo -p tsconfig.build.json"` so the parent PM — not an npm subprocess — runs the pre hook.
    - `packages/coding-agent/package.json`: `@sinclair/typebox` (used throughout `src/core/tools/*`). Split the asset-copy step out of `build` into a `postbuild` hook and removed the redundant `copy-assets` script (it was unused after the split). Collapsed `build:binary` down to a bun-only sequence and removed its `npm --prefix` recursion so it runs without npm warnings when the user is on bun.
    - `packages/web-ui/package.json`: `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`, `@sinclair/typebox`, `highlight.js` (used in the artifact renderers), and `tailwindcss` as a devDep (pulled in transitively by `@tailwindcss/cli` under npm hoisting, invisible under bun/pnpm isolation).
  - Added `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with the exact workspace list plus pnpm 10 camelCase behavior keys: `nodeLinker: hoisted` (mirrors npm's flat install so transitive imports keep resolving across workspaces without a broader direct-dep audit), `linkWorkspacePackages: deep` + `preferWorkspacePackages: true` (pnpm 10 otherwise tries to fetch `@code-yeongyu/senpi` from the public npm registry), and `onlyBuiltDependencies` (pre-approves the five native-addon postinstalls pnpm would otherwise skip). Keeping the pnpm config in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` instead of `.npmrc` avoids leaking pnpm-only keys into npm as env vars that npm then warns about.
  - Added `scripts/build-all.mjs`: PM-agnostic orchestrator that detects the parent package manager via `$npm_execpath` / `$npm_config_user_agent`, strips the known pnpm-only `npm_config_*` env keys before spawning children, and runs `<pm> run build` in each workspace in dependency order. The companion `scripts/run-web-ui-check.mjs` does the same for `packages/web-ui`'s `check`.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: package-manager compatibility, install layout, root build orchestration, and postinstall approval lists are all controlled by package/workspace config files and spawn-time env, none of which a runtime extension can intercept.
- Merge-conflict risk: low to medium per file. Expected conflict zones are the `dependencies`/`scripts` blocks of the five modified `package.json` files, the new settings and `packages` list in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and the orchestrator scripts. On the next upstream sync: (1) keep the fork's `scripts/build-all.mjs` and `scripts/run-web-ui-check.mjs`; (2) keep the `trustedDependencies` / `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` entries in root `package.json`; (3) merge additional workspace packages upstream adds into `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; (4) keep the added direct deps in the five package.json files unless upstream inlines equivalent deps.

## 2026-07-22 — RPC supported-thinking-level contract tests

- Changed: added hermetic RPC coverage for synthetic reasoning, non-reasoning, and explicit `xhigh: null` model fixtures.
- Why: RPC clients need a stable model-level capability contract before rendering thinking-level controls.
- What changed: test-only package coverage; runtime seams are documented in the matching core and RPC change logs.
- Why the extension system could not handle this: the RPC process, wire response, and model registry are package-owned surfaces.
- Merge-conflict risk: low. The test file is fork-only.

## 2026-08-02 — TypeScript native tsc migration

### What changed

- Replaced `tsgo` with `tsc` in the `dev` and `build` scripts; flags and arguments remain unchanged.
- Bumped the root `typescript` pin from `6.0.3` to `7.0.2`.
- Dropped the `@typescript/native-preview` toolchain dependency.
- Added `@typescript/typescript6@6.0.2` (Microsoft's official TypeScript-6 API bridge) so `scripts/check-ts-relative-imports.mjs` keeps working: TypeScript 7 removed the classic programmatic JS API it imported.
- Added `@typescript/native: npm:typescript@7.0.2` as a scoped alias. The `typescript6` package publicly depends on `@typescript/old` (typescript 6.x), and npm hoists it; alphabetically `@typescript/old` beats `typescript` for the `node_modules/.bin/tsc` link, which would make every bare `tsc` invocation (root check and all package builds) silently run the TypeScript 6 compiler. The alias sorts after `@typescript/old`, so it deterministically wins the `.bin/tsc` link to the 7.0.2 native compiler. It is a bin-ownership pin, not an import target.

### Why

- Adopt a stable-first toolchain policy: use the released `typescript@7.0.2` native compiler for package builds and typechecks instead of the experimental `tsgo` dev build.
- The `native-preview` compiler has been retired upstream in favor of `typescript@next`.

### Why this cannot be expressed externally

- Build scripts and `devDependencies` are package infrastructure, not runtime behavior; extensions cannot rewrite another package's manifest scripts or compiler selection.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `package.json` `scripts` and `devDependencies` versus upstream `tsgo` usage.
